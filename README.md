# job-searches
Scrape for new jobs and display them on a react web page

The idea is that some job boards (linkedin) are filled with "promoted" jobs when searching for recently posted jobs. This tool just helps find those new jobs faster and more automize.

# Requirements
- [sqlite ](https://www.sqlite.org)
- node 21 (`nvm use` if nvm available)


# Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- .... Run `npm run dev` runs the script as is
- jobs might not show up (working on adding a front end piece) but you can view them on sqlite using the queries from `Queries.md`
